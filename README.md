# Match those fragments!

A peptide fragmentation matching library for rust. Split into multiple smaller crates to help keep things organised.

## Features
 - Read pro forma sequences ('level 2-ProForma + mass spectrum compliant + glycans compliant', with the intention to fully support the whole spec)
 - Generate theoretical fragments with control over the fragmentation model from any supported pro forma peptide
   - Generate fragments from satellite ions (w, d, and v)
   - Generate glycan fragments
   - Generate theoretical fragments for modifications of unknown position
   - Generate theoretical fragments for chimeric spectra
 - Read mgf files
 - Match spectra to the generated fragments
 - Extensive use of `uom` for compile time unit checking
 - Align peptides based on mass
 - Fast access to the IMGT database of antibody germlines
 - Reading of multiple identified peptide file formats (both de novo and database matching)

## Python bindings

Python bindings are provided to several core components of the rustyms library. Go to the
[Python documentation](https://rustyms.readthedocs.io/) for more information.


# Contributing

Any contribution is welcome (especially adding/fixing documentation as that is very hard to do as main developer).

# IMGT generate
Using the `rustyms-imgt-generate` the definitions for the germlines can be updated. Put the imgt.dat.Z file in the `data` directory and unpack it (this can be downloaded from https://www.imgt.org/download/LIGM-DB/imgt.dat.Z). Then run `cargo run --release -p rustyms-imgt-generate` (from the root folder of this repository).
